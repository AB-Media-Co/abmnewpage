          <p>
            Before I created the Shopify SEO Checklist - I was struggling with getting my Shopify store to rank on the first page of Google and losing business to my competitors for years...
          </p>
          <p>
            I was hiring SEO consultants, buying backlinks, attending SEO webinars, paying for expensive SEO tools, and everything else that you’re probably doing right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of struggling, I was on the verge of giving up on SEO altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got myself a deal I never signed up for.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led me to questioning everything and eventually turning the entire model upside down, breaking all the rules of everything I was told by “SEO gurus” and decided to test every SEO strategy by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            After several months of <span className="italic">trial-and-error</span>, testing hundreds of different SEO strategies, and figuring things out the hard way - without anyone guiding me, I’ve finally reached a point where I was able to consistently rank my product and collection pages on page 1 of Google...
          </p>
          <p className="italic font-semibold text-[var(--primary)]">
            ...and with that substantially increasing my Shopify store’s organic revenue.

                            The consultations weren’t cheap, but they remain one of the best investments I’ve made to this day, as they helped me figure out my processes and systems to make it all work...

                            Now, you’ve probably never heard of optimizing the technical SEO foundation of a Shopify store before and it’s because it’s used by all of the Shopify stores ranking on page 1 of Google that you couldn't access until today…

                            …You see, the old way of ranking on page 1 of Google is all about targeting as many keywords and creating as many pages as possible while building a lot of backlinks.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-white">
                            The theory is that “when you build enough backlinks”, you’re supposed to start ranking.

                            <p className="text-white">
                            Unfortunately, most SEO gurus and agencies ignore that and prefer not to think about it.

                            If you have a leaking bucket, no matter how much water you pour into it, the bucket will never stay full.

                            If your technical SEO foundation is not optimized, then it does not matter how many links you build, or how much content you publish, because the technical SEO errors will always hold you back.

                            You see, the Shopify SEO Checklist is created specifically in order to help scale organic traffic and revenue of Shopify stores.

                            But at the end of the day, a Shopify store is nothing other than a website, with almost the exact same elements as any other website on the internet.

                            By learning how to identify and implement these SEO quick-wins, you’ll be able to do the same with any other online businesses you might come across.

                            This is the exact reason why I own online businesses in the Shopify space, alongside other businesses such as SaaS, lead gen websites, and more!

                            <p className="text-white">There’s a lot happening in the world of Shopify and SEO.</p>

                            <p className="text-white">
                            A few years ago Shopify stores could rely heavily on paid ads and still make a decent profit.

                            But today, after the iOS 14 update and a never-ending increase in paid ad costs, most Shopify stores have seen a significant increase in their expenses and a significant decline in their overall profits and profit margins.
                            </p>

                            <p className="text-white">
                            This has created the need for alternative sales channels that Shopify store owners and managers can leverage in order to profitably acquire traffic that converts.

                            </span> is that once your Shopify store starts to rank on page 1 of Google, and bring in organic revenue, you actually get to keep 100% of the profit, as there is

                            When you do SEO for your Shopify store, and you do it correctly (that is by ensuring you have a properly optimized SEO foundation), the SEO results are not only significantly amplified, but they’re also more sustainable.

                            On the contrary, if you ignore the importance of optimizing the foundational SEO elements of your Shopify store, and jump straight into content production and linkbuilding, you’ll be leaving a big chunk of your potential ROI on the table, and it will take longer and be more difficult to get REAL SEO results.

                                <strong>✅ Step 1 - Identify Unimplemented SEO Quick-Wins</strong> – Using the Shopify SEO Checklist, you’ll start by going through all of the opportunities listed in the checklist, and identify which ones have not yet been implemented on your Shopify store.
                            </p>

                                <strong>✅ Step 2 - SEO Quick-Wins Are Sorted by Highest ROI</strong> – Since there are over 115 different SEO Quick-Wins in the checklist, it’s essential we prioritize the Quick-Wins that are the easiest to implement and offer the biggest impact. This is done automatically by the checklist’s algorithm, taking the guesswork out of the process.
                            </p>

                            </p>

                                <strong>✅ Step 4 - Publish Each SEO Quick-Win As Soon As It's Implemented </strong> – Your goal should be to get as many Quick-Wins implemented as fast as possible, with that in mind, you want to make sure you publish each Quick-Win as soon as you've implemented it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>✅ Step 5 - Let Google Process The Changes & Let Your Organic Traffic Grow </strong> – Based on my experience over the past few years, the Quick-Wins are best processed during a Google Algorithm update, which typically happens once every 2 months - that's why it can sometimes take up to 90 days to see the results.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            As a Shopify store, the pages with the most potential to generate additional revenue for your business are ultimately your homepage, collection, and product pages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The reason for that is that these pages speak to potential customers who are further down the buyer’s journey, meaning that they’re much more likely to buy.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            With these pages, you want to follow a specific process, to optimize them for your target keyword, so that Google can know the exact keywords you’re trying to rank for.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            The process is slightly different across the different types of pages, hence why these 3 ON-Page SEO optimization guides will be so essential and useful if you truly want to maximize your organic revenue potential.
